# TripleTen_projects
A small selection of projects I worked on while attending the Data Science TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 |  [Statistical Data Analysis in Cell Service User Data](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/01-SDA_project) | Analyzed the behavior of 500 clients, including their location, plan usage, and the number of calls and texts made in 2018, providing a comprehensive understanding of user behavior.  |
| 2 | [Linear Algebra Insurance Classification](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/02-linear_algebra) | Evaluated customer similarity, predicted insurance benefits, and implemented data obfuscation for client data protection, providing strategic insights for Sure Tomorrow’s marketing strategies and revenue optimization. |
| 3 | [Time Series Analysis for Taxi Data](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/03-time_series) | Analyzed historical taxi order data, predicted future orders, and implemented various machine learning models for prediction accuracy, providing strategic insights for Sweet Lift Taxi’s driver allocation and service optimization. |
| 4 | [Movie Review Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/04-machine_learning_for_texts) | Built a machine learning model with text for classifying the sentiment of movie reviews using IMDB data. |
| 5 | [Computer Vision and Age Verification](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/05-computer_vision) | Explored whether Data Science and computer vision can help a supermarket Chain adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage.  |
| 6 | [Machine Learning for High Churn Risk Customer Identification](https://github.com/Jackson-Dana/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/06-machine_learning_churn_reduction) | Built a model to predict customer churn, with the goal being to allow the telecom company to offer promotional codes or a special plan for any customers flagged as being highly likely to leave. |
