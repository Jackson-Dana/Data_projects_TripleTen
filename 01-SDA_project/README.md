# TripleTen Sprint 3 Project - Statistical Data Analysis

This is the 3rd project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. This project was highly independent and provided a comprehensive understanding of user behavior for the telecom operator Megaline.

## Megaline Prepaid Plans

The goal of the project was to analyze the behavior of 500 clients in order to determine which phone plan, either Surf or Ultimate, generates more revenue. 

### The Data

The data was spread across five files:

1. `users.csv`: Contains information about the users such as their unique identifier, name, age, registration date, churn date, city of residence, and the plan they are using.
2. `calls.csv`: Contains data about the calls made by the users. It includes the unique call identifier, call date, call duration, and the identifier of the user making the call.
3. `messages.csv`: Provides data about the text messages sent by the users. It includes the unique text message identifier, text message date, and the identifier of the user sending the text.
4. `internet.csv`: Contains data about the web sessions. It includes the unique session identifier, the volume of data spent during the session (in megabytes), and the web session date.
5. `plans.csv`: Contains data about the plans. It includes the calling plan name, monthly charge in US dollars, monthly minute allowance, monthly text allowance, data volume allowance (in megabytes), price per minute after exceeding the package limits, price per text after exceeding the package limits, and price per extra gigabyte of data after exceeding the package limits.

### The Process

Analyzed the behavior of 500 clients, including their location, plan usage, and the number of calls and texts made in 2018, providing a comprehensive understanding of user behavior. 

1. Conducted a preliminary analysis of two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, to determine which brings in more revenue, leading to strategic insights for the marketing team. 
2. Performed hypothesis testing and data analysis, leading to the conclusion that one plan should be favored by the marketing team to maximize revenue.  
3. Provided recommendations for the marketing team to optimize their strategies, thereby potentially improving the companyâ€™s revenue generation.

## Results

The results were explained at each step. An introduction and conclusion were written that outlined the work done and made suggestions for Megaline to consider in the future. The Jupyter Notebook included provides a full description of the results.

## Conclusion

The project provided strategic insights for the marketing team at Megaline. Hypothesis testing and data analysis led to the conclusion that the Surf plan generated more per-user revanue. The insights gained from this project have the potential to guide future marketing strategies and optimize revenue generation. 

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for a detailed description of the results.
